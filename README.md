## About the project:
For this project, we were asked to create an App called About Me using the framework Android Studio with Kotlin, with all requirements such as 4 buttons, an image rounded with code, and some texts with some words on the bottom of the main screen. Each button should take the user to its screen.

## What I expected
When I read the requirements for the first time I thought, it can be done very quickly, even though I never had used Android Studio before, it was just because Android is very popular and maybe I could find easy some documentation and tutorials. But what I did not know is that Android Studio is very complex for beginners like me, and Kotlin for me is a new language, even though we did not really code properly, it was more like for understanding the framework, layout, buttons, in general, all the structure of the software.

## Challenge
Well, I can say that everything was challenging for me from the first time I opened Visual Studio. It took some time to prepare things.
As I don't have an android phone, I had to use the emulator, but the emulator is so heavy that I had to close everything and leave enough space for Android Studio to work as smoothly as possible.

## Challenge 1:
After re-watch some classes again, I was able to create the first screen, adding some buttons and some textView. After getting the first screen done as requested by the lecture I thought, oh ok, it’s not that hard. I uploaded and released the first version of my App. Went back to ready again the assessment guidelines, and to my surprise, we needed to use Linear Layout instead Constraint Layout, my nightmary has been started.
This time I decided to use the Material IO from google just adding it to the Grade file.
I needed to learn how to implement everything that I have been doing but using Linear Layout. That took me a lot of time and some stress. One of the screens I’m using “fragment Layout”, yes, “fragment” without capital F and I don’t know why, but it is like that and it is working.

## Challenge 2:
After finally I could make the first screens ready and 4 buttons were clicked and it was taken the user to the next screen, I realized that the top bar was not displaying the name of the screen. I tried to fix this issue but it took me so many hours and I messed up all my code, and there were so many comments that I could not come back the time it was working… so I decided to delete everything I had been doing and start from scratch.

## Challenge 3:
The next day, after so much stress, I was googling how to add the bottom nav bar with icons, instead of 4 buttons in the middle of the screen. I learned something called “Fragment”. I found a guy on YouTube(the link of his video is commented on my project), that showed how to apply Fragment with icons on the bottom, when clicked it takes us to the next screen. It was everything that I needed! I just did the same but with 5 icons and it worked very well.

## Challenge 4:
Now that every icon was clickable and it was taken the user to the next screen, I would like to go further and add a favorite icon on the top of each screen, but unfortunately, I could not make it work. I have been trying so many different things but none of them has been working. A top menu on the top of other, app crash while opening it… no many different issues. I hope to be able to fix it later on.

## Final thoughts
Even though I am still very beginner, I have been learning a lot about how to use Android Studio with kotlin, I hope to be able to develop something really helpful and help others as they have been helping me with documentation, videos.
